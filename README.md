## Simple City Stars

People looking for information on night sky visibility may come across Clear Sky Charts, an astronomerâ€™s forecast website based in Canada with decades of history that provides coverage for over 3000 observing sites across North America.  

Based off of Clear Sky Charts, 7Timer! is a site created in July 2005 in China that produces forecasts for the entire globe across about 1.5 million geographic points.  

These sites show a lot of information that has a high learning curve to understand and use. They have very informative displays but can be less user-friendly.  

My project centralizes the data provided by the 7Timer! API combined with sunrise and sunset data. It seeks to provide simple and relevant information in one place to help casual stargazers decide and plan when they will be able to spend some of their free time watching the stars. 
The form page allows the user to select from a range of locations and time ranges for which he would like to get forecasts.  

He will have to select at least one of each set of options to make a successful request.  

If he makes a successful request, he will see his forecasts displayed.  

For each location, he will get a table of sunrise sunset data and a table of atmospheric weather data.  

If he would like to modify his selection, he can go back using his browser navigation. Or, he can start over by using the return button.  

The data is clear and intuitive on its own. However, if he still wants to learn more about the data, he can read the short descriptions.
