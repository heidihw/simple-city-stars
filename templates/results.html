    <h5>What do the numbers for Day and Hour mean again?</h5>
    <p>The values for Days and Hours represent for how many units of time out from the present time the conditions will be forecasted. 
      For example, 0 Days will give the sunrise and sunset forecasts for today, and 1 Days for tomorrow. 
      Likewise, 3 Hours will give the astronomical viewing condition forecasts for 3 hours from the end of the current hour, 
      and 24 Hours for 1 full day from the present time.</p>
    <h5>What is Nautical Twilight?</h5>
    <p>Nautical twilight begins and ends when the sun is 12 degrees below the horizon. 
      Between nautical sunrise and sunset, sunlight obscures the stars, but bright planets are still visible.</p>
    <p>Civil twilight is listed in the table above as twilight. 
      It begins and ends when the sun is at 6 degrees below the horizon, and astronomical twilight at 18 degrees.</p>
    <h5>What does the number for Cloud Cover mean?</h5>
    <p>If cloud cover is less than 3 on the scale from 1 to 9, the sky should be mostly free of clouds.</p>
    <h5>What should I do with the Precipitation Type forecast?</h5>
    <p>There may be precipitation of types snow, rain, frzr (freezing rain), icep (ice pellets), or none. 
      If there is precipitation, consider staying indoors.</p>
    <h5>What is Transparency?</h5>
    <p>If transparency is greater than 6 on the scale from 1 to 8, you should be able to see stars in the sky.</p>
    <p>"Transparency forecasts the transparency of the air. 
      Here 'transparency' means just what astronomers mean by the word: the total transparency of the atmosphere from ground to space. 
      It's calculated from the total amount of water vapor in the air. 
      It is somewhat independant of the cloud cover forecast in that there can be isolated clouds in a transparent air mass, 
      and poor transparency can occur when there is very little cloud.</p>
    <p>Above average transparency is necessary for good observation of low contrast objects like galaxies and nebulae. 
      However, open clusters and planetary nebulae are quite observable in below average transparency. 
      Large globulars and planets can be observed in poor transparency."</p>
